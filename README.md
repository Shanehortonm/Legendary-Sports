Sports Website


My project is a mock website for information about the
Dallas cowboys. It is a three page website, consisting
Of a landing page, a past page and a present page. I plan
to continue developing this website for use in my portfolio.

The requirements that I ment where:

                   1. Use of Chart.js
                   2. Use of arrays to display data (being pulled from api)
                   3. Use of a api (sportdata.io)



There are no special requirements to run.
Visual studio code was used as code editor.
All features work on different browsers, but recommend chrome for best experience.
